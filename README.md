# Deni-Workday-Scheduler-hw5

This assignment was fun and resonated with me personally as this sort of application is used in my daily work. I could really see the usefulness and real-world application with this assignment. The goal for this assignment was to create a daily work-day schedule broken down with hourly task rows.

When using the daily planner, the current day/time is displayed at the top of the page using Moment.js, then below is an 8-hour day of time blocks.

Each time block is color-coded based on past, present, and future relative to the current time of day. A user can click on the timeblock and enter a "task" then save that task to local storage, so upon page refresh, the task will persist.

Here is a quick screen recording of the page functionality: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P-CfdiXzmD7Jwr-4zrs2WbNSqaPBNkf-/view?usp=sharing
